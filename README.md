I was intrigued by a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/PHammondMP/status/809628170471116800) by
the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer stating "exports have doubled over
the last year. Now worth nearly £11bn” and a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesBerryMP/status/809341634378866689) by
Member of the UK Parliament stating South Korea "our second fastest
growing trading partner". Although I have never paid much attention to
trade statistics, both these statements seemed surprising. But these
days it's easy enough to verify such statements. It's also an
opportunity to use the techniques I believe data scientists in
(computer) game companies use to determine how much impact a new
feature has on the game's consumers.
